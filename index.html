    During this project, I worked on the custom level and the custom mechanic that we added, i.e. the dash. I was also responsible for developing the jump mechanic as well and also the enemy development for Skree, Ripper and Reo. 
    I made extensive use of coroutines for spacing actions over multiple frames such as the parabolic movement of the Reo. I also made extensive use of Raycasting for detection, whether it be detection of terrain (for the player), 
    or for detection of the player (for enemies like the Skree and Reo).

    I was also responsible for implementing the animations, specifically for the running, the morphball animations, and also the special animations for run jumping. I was also responsible for adding in the animation for dashing.

    The game engine and language used for this project were Unity and C# respectively.

    This project was inspired by Hollow Knight and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. I wanted to combine the metroidvania aspects of Hollow Knight with the focus of combat that Sekiro has.

    Set in a medieval dungeon, you the hero, are tasked with retriveing a wizard's Orb of Pondering. You must venture through the local dungeon to retrive it, but beware the foes that
    lurk in the dark!

    This project was entirely developed by me in C# and Unity. The assets used from the Unity Asset Store and are credited to: Luiz Melo, Sven Thole, and Szadi Art.
    The project might be extended to have a bigger dungeon, with more power ups, more loot, and even more dangerous enemies!
