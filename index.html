    During this project, I worked on the custom level and the custom mechanic that we added, i.e. the dash. I was also responsible for developing the jump mechanic as well and also the enemy development for Skree, Ripper and Reo. 
    I made extensive use of coroutines for spacing actions over multiple frames such as the parabolic movement of the Reo. I also made extensive use of Raycasting for detection, whether it be detection of terrain (for the player), 
    or for detection of the player (for enemies like the Skree and Reo).

    I was also responsible for implementing the animations, specifically for the running, the morphball animations, and also the special animations for run jumping. I was also responsible for adding in the animation for dashing.

    The game engine and language used for this project were Unity and C# respectively.
