<!-- TODO: Erase one of these two. Replace the 'href' link below with a link to your WebGL build page. -->
 <!-- Game 1: -->
<ul>
<li><a href="https://adahad27.itch.io/metroidremake">Metroid (Remade)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    During this project, I worked on the custom level and the custom mechanic that we added, i.e. the dash. I was also responsible for developing the jump mechanic as well and also the enemy development for Skree, Ripper and Reo. 
    I made extensive use of coroutines for spacing actions over multiple frames such as the parabolic movement of the Reo. I also made extensive use of Raycasting for detection, whether it be detection of terrain (for the player), 
    or for detection of the player (for enemies like the Skree and Reo).
</p>

<p>
    I was also responsible for implementing the animations, specifically for the running, the morphball animations, and also the special animations for run jumping. I was also responsible for adding in the animation for dashing.
</p>

<p>
    The game engine and language used for this project were Unity and C# respectively.

</p>
<!-- Game 2: -->
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://adahad27.itch.io/deflectking">DeflectKing</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    This project was inspired by Hollow Knight and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. I wanted to combine the metroidvania aspects of Hollow Knight with the focus of combat that Sekiro has.
</p>
<p>
    Set in a medieval dungeon, you the hero, are tasked with retriveing a wizard's Orb of Pondering. You must venture through the local dungeon to retrive it, but beware the foes that
    lurk in the dark!
</p>
<p>
    This project was entirely developed by me in C# and Unity. The assets used from the Unity Asset Store and are credited to: Luiz Melo, Sven Thole, and Szadi Art.
    The project might be extended to have a bigger dungeon, with more power ups, more loot, and even more dangerous enemies!
</p>
<!-- Game 3: -->
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://adahad27.itch.io/escape-eecs">Escape EECS</a></li>
</ul>
<!-- TODO: Erase one of these two. Replace the 'href' link below with a link to your WebGL build page. -->
<p>
    This project was inspired Greek Tragedy, Outlast, Dead by Daylight and Resident Evil! The original concept of the game was a parody game where the player is stuck in the EECS building and must escape by completing a series of puzzles.
    However over the course of development, us as a team decided to move in more interesting direction and tried to avoid following what previous horror games had done. We instead settled on making the concept of avoiding detection one
    of the core mechanics in our game! Now the game is far more terrifying (or so I'm told) and we do hope you play it!
</p>
<p>
    You are a Computer Science major pulling an all-nighter in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science building to finish your coding project when the lights go out! Can you successfully escape the darkness and the danger that lurks within?
</p>
<p>
    This project was developed by Jaccob Bell, Abhishek Dahad (me), Andy He, Daniel Tok, Duc Vu, and Charlie Vu. The project was developed using C# and Unity. The modelling for some of the props was done in Blender. Other
    models were sourced from the Unity Asset Store and Sketchfab.
